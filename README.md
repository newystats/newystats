- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert King - @newystats
- 👀 I’m interested in R, statistics, and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning moving my local git repositories for my R packages onto github.  I think I'm a bit unusual that I've had a package on CRAN for 20 years before having it on github 😲
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on flexibly shaped distributions.
- 📫 How to reach me robert.king.newcastle@gmail.com
